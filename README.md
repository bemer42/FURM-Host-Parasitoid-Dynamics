# FURM-Host-Parasitoid-Dynamics
This repository contains all appropriate MATLAB and Python program files associated to the FURM book chapter entitled "The mathematics of host-parasitoid population dynamics."

There are four folders contained in the repository.  Each folder corresponds to a section number from the book chapter.  

In each folder, you'll find a number of m-files.  Each m-file corresponds to a figure or model from the text.  

Please feel free to use the m-files as a template for exploring different models of host-parasitoid interactions!  Enjoy.
